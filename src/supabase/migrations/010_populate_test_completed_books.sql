-- ============================================
-- Migration: Populate Test Completed Books
-- Description: Add sample completed books for testing the Books Read count
-- Date: October 27, 2025
-- ============================================

-- This migration adds test data for users to have completed books
-- This is OPTIONAL and only for testing/demo purposes

-- Add 5 completed books for each regular user
-- Uses random books and ratings (3-5 stars)
-- Sets realistic finish dates (within last 90 days)
